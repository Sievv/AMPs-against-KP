These three bacteria are major causes of hospital- and community-acquired infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and wound infections.

Multi-Drug Resistance Concerns:

They are known for their increasing resistance to multiple antibiotics, making treatment difficult and highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic options like AMPs.

Gram-Negative Bacteria:

All three are Gram-negative bacteria, which have a unique outer membrane structure that often makes them more resistant to antibiotics. Studying AMPs against these bacteria is crucial because they pose a significant challenge in antimicrobial therapy.
