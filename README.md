These three bacteria are major causes of hospital- and community-acquired infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and wound infections.

Multi-Drug Resistance Concerns:

They are known for their increasing resistance to multiple antibiotics, making treatment difficult and highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic options like AMPs.

Gram-Negative Bacteria:

All three are Gram-negative bacteria, which have a unique outer membrane structure that often makes them more resistant to antibiotics. Studying AMPs against these bacteria is crucial because they pose a significant challenge in antimicrobial therapy.

ðŸ“… Description of Peptide Feature Calculations
Feature	Description
###Length	Number of amino acid residues in the peptide sequence.
###Charge	Net charge of the peptide, calculated by counting positively charged residues (Lysine, Arginine, Histidine) minus negatively charged residues (Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid).
###Hydrophobicity	Sum of hydrophobic residues (A, V, I, L, M, F, W, P) in the sequence based on Kyte-Doolittle scale.
###Molecular Weight	Total molecular weight of the peptide calculated from the amino acid sequence using Biopythonâ€™s molecular weight function.
###Number of Cysteines	Count of cysteine residues (C) in the peptide sequence.
###Number of Disulfide Bridges	Estimated as the integer division of cysteine count by 2, assuming cysteines form pairs to make disulfide bonds.
###Isoelectric Point (pI)	Simplified estimate of the peptideâ€™s isoelectric point based on counts of acidic (D, E) and basic (K, R, H) residues weighted by their pKa values.
###Amino Acid Composition	Percentage of each standard amino acid (A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y) within the peptide.
###Secondary Structure Features	Counts of residues associated with secondary structures: Helix-forming (A, L, I, V, M, F, Y, W), Sheet-forming (F, Y, W), and Turn-forming (G, P). Flexibility is the proportion of ###helix residues to total length.
